User script for hiding some Trello lists.

* Adds a button for each list on the header menu that toggles them
* Lists will auto-collapse on load if there is a "--" in their name

Tested on Chrome and Firefox. Works with tampermonkey and greasemonkey.

* [Click to install](https://github.com/shesek/trello-hide-lists/raw/master/trello-hide-lists.user.js).
